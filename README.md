# *args-python


Better method to use multiple arguments in function call.

In normal method we pass each variable as an argument, Here also we are using the same for making function call.

But at receiving side, instead of receving values in seperate variables we use *args ---> This will avoid the use of seperate variable in function executing.

We can access these variables with the help of a for loop as shown in the code.
